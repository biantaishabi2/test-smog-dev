The shared dependencies between the files "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css" for a simple personal website using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for styling are:

1. **HTML Elements**: The "index.html" file will contain all the HTML elements that make up the structure of the website. These elements will have unique id names that will be used in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to apply styles. For example, ids like "header", "main", "footer" etc.

2. **CSS Classes**: The "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will contain CSS classes that are used to style the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. These classes will be shared between the HTML and CSS files. For example, classes like ".container", ".text-center", ".bg-dark" etc.

3. **Tailwind CSS Utility Classes**: The "tailwind.css" file will contain Tailwind CSS utility classes that are used to style the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. These utility classes will be shared between the HTML and Tailwind CSS files. For example, utility classes like ".text-xl", ".bg-black", ".p-4" etc.

4. **Link to CSS Files**: The "index.html" file will contain links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This is a shared dependency as the HTML file needs to know the location of the CSS files in order to apply the styles.

5. **Media Queries**: The "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files may contain media queries for responsive design. These media queries will be shared between the CSS files. For example, "@media (min-width: 640px)" etc.

Note: As this is a simple personal website built with HTML and CSS, there are no exported variables, data schemas, JavaScript functions, or message names involved.
